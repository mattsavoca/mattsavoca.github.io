I am a data scientist specializing in sports and media technology working on a variety of complex statistical problems. I leverage machine learning, simulations and data visualization to provide unique insights. I have developed predictive metrics and engineered data pipelines which have been integrated into a variety of digital platforms and applications. As an unabashed data storyteller and effective presenter, I relish opportunities to present my findings and regularly appear in various forms of digital media including podcasts, videos, live broadcasts, and more.
