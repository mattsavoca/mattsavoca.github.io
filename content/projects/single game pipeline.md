title: "Automated Analysis and Insight Data Pipeline for Athletic Competitions and Proxy Games"
---

I developed an automated reporting structure for NFL single-game contests, specifically for Daily Fantasy Sports platforms like DraftKings and FanDuel. Leveraging R Shiny, Plotly, and APIs, I created custom data visualizations that highlighted game environments and key performance indicators. These included projected versus expected fantasy points and custom metrics like True Drive Success Rate for quarterbacks.

The system enabled real-time, multi-game reporting, freeing up analysts to focus on insights and storytelling. This innovation significantly expanded the site's DFS content offerings and was widely lauded for increasing viewership, engagement, and profitability.
