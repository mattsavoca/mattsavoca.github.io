title: "Predictive Resource Optimization Platform"

---

As the lead data scientist, I developed a predictive analytics platform designed to optimize decision-making in constrained, high-stakes environments. By leveraging Python, R, SQL, and gradient boosting models (XGBoost), I created robust range-of-outcome forecasts with floor, median, and ceiling projections. These forecasts utilized over 50 features, including contextual data streams such as time-sensitive metrics, correlation insights, and external indicators to ensure comprehensive modeling.

To enhance adaptability and accuracy, I implemented a simulation framework that incorporated smaller machine learning models to model relationships between key inputs. This approach enabled dynamic scenario analysis and improved confidence in resource allocation recommendations.

The system introduced near real-time updates, with predictive insights refreshed every 15 minutes, significantly increasing reliability and decision-making agility. Parallel processing techniques using the Arrow and future packages in R reduced data aggregation time by over 50%, ensuring the platform's scalability for real-time analytics. Additionally, we collaborated with domain experts to integrate financial back-testing capabilities, enabling stakeholders to validate the system's performance against historical data.

This project resulted in a measurable increase in operational efficiency, enhanced user engagement, and streamlined workflows for strategic decision-making across varied contexts.
