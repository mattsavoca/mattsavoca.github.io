title: "Athlete Lifetime (Single-Season) Value Simulation Platform"
---

I developed a simulation platform that calculated lifetime value metrics for entities, specifically tailored to fantasy sports. Built using R, rShiny, and the ffSimulator package, the tool enabled users to upload custom player rankings from Underdog.com—a leading fantasy drafting platform—and generate simulations based on their inputs.

The platform provided a user-friendly front-end dashboard where users could explore personalized projections, including ranges of outcomes such as floor and ceiling values. A standout feature was the introduction of "usable weeks," a novel metric that quantified the weeks a player could meaningfully contribute to a lineup. This metric, akin to a lifetime value calculation, demonstrated its broader applicability beyond the sports domain.

Key technical innovations included seamless integration of user-uploaded rankings, dynamic simulations using the ffSimulator package, and real-time visualizations within the rShiny framework. The system’s interactivity and customizability set it apart, making complex simulations accessible to non-technical users.

The project gained significant recognition within the fantasy sports community, leading to press coverage and invitations to discuss the tool on YouTube shows and podcasts throughout the 2024 season.
